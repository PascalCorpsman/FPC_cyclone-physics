# FPC cyclone-physics

>
> As i got stuck in writing my own 3D physics engine [CorP3D](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/CorP3D) i decided to "recode" a existing one in order to learn enough to finish CorP3D.

FPC cyclone-physics is a 3D physics game engine. It is developed in the book [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768).

Ian Millington starts from scratch in his book, and so do i here in this repository. The plan is to read trough the book and implement step by step the whole engine in FreePascal (aka crossporting the C++ code given in the book).

Goal is to have at the end a fully working 3D physics library (the same as in the book) and also port the [Demos](src/Demos).

If you do not wan't to wait up until i finished reading the book you can try look at the books github repository which is located [here](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics).

### What is needed to compile and run the code ?

1. clone this repository

Now you have everything to compile the engine.


### Progress
- 2025.05.23: created repository, readme.md and license.md
